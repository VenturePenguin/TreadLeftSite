It explains how TreadLeft (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, shares, and protects information.

1) Information We Collect
A. Information You Provide
- Account information: When you sign in, we associate your account with identifiers from your authentication provider (for example, your Strava account via OAuth).
- Preferences and settings: Such as unit preferences (km/mi), theme settings, and other in-app configuration.

B. Information We Receive from Strava (If You Connect Strava)
If you connect Strava, we access information necessary to provide the Service, which may include:
- Profile information (e.g., athlete ID, name, profile image if available).
- Activity data (e.g., run activities, dates/times, distance, and workout details used to compute mileage and trends).
- Gear data (e.g., shoes/gear list and related mileage used for wear tracking).
We only request and use Strava data consistent with the permissions you grant during the Strava authorization flow.

C. Diagnostics / Telemetry (App Reliability Only)
We collect limited app diagnostics and telemetry to maintain and improve reliability, such as device model, OS version, app version/build, operational events (e.g., sync status), and error logs/crash indicators.
We do not use this diagnostics data for advertising, cross‑app tracking, or marketing profiling.

2) How We Use Information
We use information to: (a) provide the Service (sync Strava data, track shoe mileage, show dashboards/trends), (b) maintain and improve reliability, (c) provide support, and (d) improve security and prevent abuse.

3) How We Share Information
We do not sell your personal information.
We may share information only: (a) with service providers that process data on our behalf to operate the Service, (b) for legal/safety reasons, or (c) as part of a business transfer (e.g., merger or acquisition), subject to appropriate safeguards.

4) Data Storage and Security
We use reasonable safeguards designed to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is fully secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

5) Data Retention
We retain information as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. You may request deletion.

6) Your Choices and Rights
Disconnecting Strava: You can remove TreadLeft’s access in Strava settings; syncing will stop. Previously imported data may remain unless you request deletion.
Access/Correction/Deletion: Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your information. Contact us.

7) Notifications
If the app provides notifications (e.g., shoe wear alerts), you can control permissions in your device settings.

8) Children’s Privacy
TreadLeft is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum legal age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

9) International Users
Your information may be processed in countries where we or our providers operate. We take steps to protect your information consistent with this policy.

10) Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy from time to time and will update the Effective Date above.
